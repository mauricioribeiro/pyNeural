# pyNeural
<h3>Aritificial Neural Network classes (Python 2.7)</h3>
<p>pyNeural is a simple set of classes for generate ANNs (<i>Artificial Neural Networks</i>) easily. It isn't done yet. Any suggestion? Ask for be a contributor.</p>
<br>
##Main Functions
<h5>setWeights(weightsArray)</h5>
<ul>
<li><b>weightsArray [float List]</b> is an array of weight values.</li>
<li>This function is a void function which sets the Neuron weights. Just to remember, the class Neuron receives as parameter the amount of weights (nWeights). After you initialize the class, you can set its weights or use the random weights generated.</li>
</ul>
<h5>setInputs(inputArray)</h5>
<ul>
<li><b>inputArray [float List]</b> is an array of inputs values (ps: the array must be same size of Neuron.weights).</li>
<li>This function is a void function which sets the Neuron inputs.</li>
</ul>
<h5>setWeight(index,value):</h5>
<ul>
<li><b>index [int]</b> is the weight position desired to change. PS: Beginning by 1.</li>
<li><b>value [float]</b> is a new value of weight specified by index.</li>
<li>This function is a void function which sets the a specified weight.</li>
</ul>

##Getting Started
<p>There is a test file with a basic example about how an unique neuron works.</p>
