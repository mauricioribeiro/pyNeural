<h3>Aritificial Neural Network classes (For Python 2.7 and 3.4)</h3>
<p>pyNeural is a simple set of classes for generating ANNs (<i>Artificial Neural Networks</i>) easily. It isn't done yet. If you have any suggestions, feel free  to become a contributor.</p>
<br>
##pyNeural versions:
<a href="https://github.com/mauricioribeiro/pyNeural/tree/master/2.7" target="_blank"><h4>pyNeural classes for Python 2.7</h4></a>
<p>pyNeural for Python 2.7 provides a Neuron class with the main Transfer Functions <b>step</b>, <b>sign</b>, <b>linear</b> and <b>sigmoid</b>, a brief documentation and an example file.</p>
<br>
<a href="https://github.com/mauricioribeiro/pyNeural/tree/master/3.4" target="_blank"><h4>pyNeural classes for Python 3.4</h4></a>
<p>pyNeural for Python 3.4 also provides a Neuron class with the main Transfer Functions <b>step</b>, <b>sign</b>, <b>linear</b> and <b>sigmoid</b>. So, what's the new? This version contains the new network class: <i>Backpropagation Net</i>.</p>@
